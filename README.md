# meetandcreate
👋 Hi there! I’m a 16-year-old beginner coder, diving into programming just three months ago. Currently, I’m working on my first website project and loving every bit of the learning process. I’m passionate about meeting new people and enjoy creating random, fun projects in my free time. Always open to connect and collaborate—let’s build something awesome together! 🌐💻
